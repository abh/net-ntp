Net/NTP version $Revision: 1.1.1.1 $ 
====================

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the
README file from a module distribution so that people browsing the
archive can use it get an idea of the modules uses. It is usually a
good idea to provide version information here so that people can
decide whether fixes for the module are worth downloading.

Having h2xs said that ... :-)

This module will allow you to send a packet to an NTP server, get 
a response back, and then parse out the results according to RFC1305 
and RFC2030.

At present, this is a developer release.  This is NOT because of the 
code itself, but because of the lack of testing againist various 
time sources to verify that the code is, in fact, doing what it's 
supposed to do.  It has been tested againist public stratum 1 and 
stratum 2 servers with good results.  However, it would be helpful to 
have a variety of results for comparison.

There is a test script located in the eg directory for your use.
